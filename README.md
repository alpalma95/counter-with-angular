# Counter

You can check the preview [here](https://counter-with-angular.vercel.app/).

Full disclosure: this is a dummy project. Yet another counter that increases with a button. **BUT**:

This has been my first "solo diving" into Angular and the CLI tool. You know, just to practice a bit and to make sure that I have a good grasp of the basics, at least. Quick recap of what I've learned and practiced:

- Component generation with Angular CLI and putting them together.
- Conditional classes
- Component's state and receiving "props" with Input()
- And the biggest deal: Event emitters

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.
